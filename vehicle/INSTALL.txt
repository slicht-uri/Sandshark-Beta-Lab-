Sandshark UUV Code Setup and Build Procedure

All of the code for the Sandshark AUV (vehicle side) resides in this repository.  The following text will explain the setup and build procedure.  If you have any issues when working through the document, email sandshark-maintainer@bluefinrobotics.com

Vehicle-Side Instructions (The following instructions were designed and tested for an Ubuntu 14.04.03 system):

-Setting up your environment and getting ROS
--Download and install ROS Indigo "Desktop Install" by following the instructions at: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu

-Setting up the sysroot (an arm sysroot including ros compiled for arm is used to cross compile the code for the Sandshark)
--Clone the sandshark github repo into your home folder (cd ~/ && git clone https://github.com/bluefinrobotics/sandshark.git)
--Make a /usr/local/bluefin directory (sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bluefin)
--Make a /home/adapt directory (sudo mkdir -p /home/adapt)
--Make the following symlinks:
---sudo ln -s /home/<username>/sandshark/vehicle/adapt-sysroot /usr/local/bluefin/adapt-sysroot
---sudo mkdir /home/adapt/rosalign
---sudo ln -s /usr/local/bluefin/adapt-sysroot/ros_install_isolated /home/adapt/rosalign/install_isolated
---sudo mkdir /home/adapt/ADAPT
---sudo ln -s /usr/local/bluefin/adapt-sysroot /home/adapt/ADAPT/titan-sysroot
--Make a /data/app/bluefin/opt/ros_xc directory (sudo mkdir -p /data/app/bluefin/opt/ros_xc)  This is where catkin will put all of the executables and libraries after they are built
--change the owner and group of the /data/app/bluefin/opt/ros_xc directory to your username (sudo chown <username>:<username> /data/app/bluefin/opt/ros_xc)
--change permissions of the /data/app/bluefin/opt/ros_xc directory to 775 (sudo chmod 755 /data/app/bluefin/opt/ros_xc)

-Building the code
--cd to the ~/sandshark/vehicle/ros directory
--Run the build_arm.sh script.  The build should complete in around 2 minutes.

-Deploying code to the vehicle
--To deploy code to a vehicle, ensure that the build machine is on the same network and run the build_arm.sh script with the vehicle's IP address as an argument (./build_arm.sh xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
