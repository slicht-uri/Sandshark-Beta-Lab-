<h1>Sensor Calibration</h1>

The ADAPT sensors can be calibrated with the buttons on the right. The Accelerometer (ACCEL) and Magnetometer (MAG) calibrations involve rotating the vehicle around. Please ensure motor power is off.

<h2>Accelerometer Calibration</h2>

Ensure the vehicle is on a absolutely level surface and click ACCEL. Follow the instructions that will show up as status. This calibration procedure will require moving the vehicle at 90 degree angles (upright, left, right, front, back, and upside down), then clicking the button to save that position.

<h2>Magnetometer Calibration</h2>

Ensure the vehicle is clear of any metal, magnetic, or ferrus materials, and sitting on a flat surface. Click the MAG button and wait for the calibration to complete.
